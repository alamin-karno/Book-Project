# Book-Project
This is a problem solving of Java Code.


## Create a class named Book. The class have the following instance data members: [5 marks]

o Book name
o ISBN number
o Author name
o Publisher
o Price

The class will have two constructors. First constructor will set values for Book name and 
ISBN number variables. Second constructor will set values for Author name, Publisher 
and Price.

Provide setter method and getter method for each instance variables so that each 
instance can be updated by the objects. Write update price method that will update the 
price to 5% if the price is below 200 otherwise to 3%.

Write a display method that will display all the information of a Book.
In the Main method, create an array of objects for 10 class Book and invoke the 
display method to show the information for each object.

# N.B: There must be this keyword in the constructors and in the setter methods.
There also be the application of data hiding such that instance variables cannot be 
accessed from outside of the class. Now write a java program following the above 
conditions.
